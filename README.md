##The goal of the project

Do you have some video files you want to be mashed together into a new webm? Well, nowadays you can't (atleast what I've seen, send links to daniel at bosser.com (replace 'at' with @. Spam is dreadful...)). This is going to be, more or less, a javascript based webm video exporter.
